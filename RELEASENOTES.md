# 🎉 DooDoo Log v1.0 - The "Golden Drop" Update

**Welcome to the premier launch of DooDoo Log!** 
We've redesigned the bathroom experience to be warmer, smarter, and—dare we say—more fun.

## 💩 What's New?

### 1. The "Healthy Poop" Bonus 🏆
We believe good health should be rewarded! The XP system has been rebalanced:
- **Gold Standard (Types 3 & 4)**: Now grant **1.5x XP**! 
- **Close Calls (Types 2 & 5)**: Now grant **1.1x XP**.
- Aim for that smooth snake shape to level up faster!

### 2. Social Features (Beta) 👯
Ever wondered how your friends are doing? (Okay, maybe not *that* specifically).
- **Add Friends**: Search for users like `Gary_The_Log` or `BobBuilder`.
- **The Feed**: See a timeline of your friends' activity.
- **React**: Support them with a 🎉 or a sympathetic 😨.

### 3. AI Commentary 🤖
Your personal bathroom assistant is here. 
- Enable **AI Insights** in your profile to get a witty roast or a high-five after every log.
- It analyzes your Bristol Type and Notes to give custom feedback.

### 4. Search & Filter 🔍
- Lost that one note about the spicy burrito? Use the new **Search Bar** in the History tab.
- Filter your history by Bristol Type to see trends.

### 5. Visual Upgrades 🎨
- **Dark Mode**: Fully supported for those late-night logs.
- **Brown Theme**: A warm, earthy palette (`#8a6a5c`) that feels right at home.
- **Blood & Clog Indicators**: New icons in the history list make major events easier to spot.
